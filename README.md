Hello! I'm new here. My name is Arthur

I have experience in C# (WPF and Xamarin), XAML, HTML, javascript, SQL. I'd describe myself as a full stack developer.

I'm keen to get involved with something, though I'm not sure what. I'm interesting in cryptocurrency, so by proxy blockchain. Maybe I'll check that out.

Personal interests include chess, developing my website, mindfulness, learning and writing essays, and sport. Perhaps I'll find something to pique one of these interests.
Feel free to get in touch!
