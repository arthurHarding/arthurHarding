Hello! I'm Arthur.

I have experience in C# (WPF and Xamarin), XAML, HTML, javascript, SQL (as well as F#, VB.NET, wordpress, PHP, and more). I'd describe myself as a full stack developer.

Personal interests include chess, developing my website, mindfulness, learning and writing essays, and sport.
Feel free to get in touch!
